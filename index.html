  This article explores how aerodynamics enables Formula One (F1) cars to achieve high 
  speeds. It emphasises on three key areas: downforce, drag reduction systems and cooling. 
  Downforce generated by inverted aircraft wings increase traction and stability on sharp 
  corners but it does increase drag too. This is where drag reduction systems attempt to 
  reduce the drag on straight paths, enabling higher speeds. Airflow also helps engine cooling, 
  which can maintain optimal performance during a race. As a whole, aerodynamics is shown 
  to be crucial in balancing downforce, drag and efficient cooling, thus allowing F1 cars to 
  achieve higher speeds and greater stability.

  Formula One (F1) cars are among the fastest vehicles on the planet, going as fast as 
  220mph <a href=”https://www.directv.com/insider/f1-cars/”>(DIRECTV Insider, 2025)</a>, the exhilaration of watching these cars race against each 
  other has garnered a vast group of dedicated fans all over the world. An essential factor that 
  allows these vehicles to travel as fast as possible is aerodynamics <a href=”https://www.jsr.org/hs/index.php/path/article/view/1475/703”>(Pandit and Day, 2021)</a>, 
  which is the study of forces acting on objects moving through the air <a href="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/learn-about-aerodynamics/#">(Hall, 2023)</a>. But how 
  exactly does making an F1 car more aerodynamic increase the speed at which it can travel? 
  There are many areas in an F1 car that are greatly improved purely by the principles of 
  aerodynamics, such areas include downforce, DRS, cooling, among others. These all, in one 
  way or another, contribute to increasing the speed of the vehicle for the greatest chance of 
  winning a race. This article will go into more depth on these concepts and explain how 
  aerodynamic principles help F1 cars achieve high speeds.

  <h4 id="Downforce">Downforce</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  Aircrafts utilise their wings to produce a force called lift, which allows them to lift off into the 
  air. Lift occurs due to the air moving fast over the wings causing low air pressure to be 
  present above the wing, thus, air moves slower under the wing but has higher pressure 
  under the wing. This difference in air pressure produces lift. F1 does the opposite of this 
  process, the engineers want the air to accelerate under the wing to create the area of low air 
  pressure beneath the wing. They simply do this by inverting an aircraft wing. Instead of lift 
  the imbalance creates downforce. This force is vital for F1 cars as it helps to increase speed 
  at corners and decrease the damage to tyres, however, this does slightly increase the air 
  resistance, or drag, which can reduce straight line speeds <a href="https://thegsaljournal.com/2020/06/28/aerodynamics-in-formula-1/">(Ayushman, 2020)</a>.
  </pre>

  <h4 id="DRS (Drag Reduction System)">DRS (Drag Reduction System)</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  DRS (or drag reduction system) was introduced to F1 in 2011 and it revolutionalised how 
  fast cars could travel. It enables the rear wing flap to be horizontal during certain sections on 
  the race track. This reduces the aerodynamic drag by about 20%, which increases the 
  chance of the driver to get ahead in the race. When activated, the flap switches from a high 
  downforce position to a low drag position, which then enables the car to reach higher straight 
  speeds. However, this is only allowed when the driver is one second away from the driver 
  ahead of them <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/7/9/309">(Loução, Duarte and Mendes, 2022)</a>. The aerodynamic principles help the car 
  gain lost seconds caused by the downforce on those tight corners to gain speed on those 
  straight paths. This essential system emphasises the balance between downforce and drag, 
  when the wing opens the downforce is reduced meaning that the car will increase in speed 
  but lose grip as it is not being pulled to the ground. This is why DRS is only effective on 
  straight paths where stability is not as important, stability is more important on those corners.

  <h4 id="Cooling">Cooling</h4>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  Aerodynamics also plays an essential role in cooling down the internal components of the 
  car. Driving at such high speeds requires a lot of energy and produces a lot of heat. Without 
  an efficient cooling system, performance would decrease and the car would not be able to 
  travel as fast due to the potential of some systems failing. F1 engines can get as hot as 120 
  degrees celsius. The way aerodynamics help the engine to cool down is due to the air 
  flowing into cooling ducts on the sidepods and the air box located on top of the racer’s head. 
  While the air flows through, a cooling liquid is then transported through various pipes that are 
  present through the most important parts of the engine. The heat from the engine is moved 
  away somewhere else via the cool pipes, this occurs due to heat transfer <a href="https://flowracers.com/blog/f1-engine-temperature/?srsltid=AfmBOoojOZAIkeqKmKdGGmmLg-Z4kfFM9W1-igcUFsQZWYl3fugbY0wn">(Opong, 2022)</a>. 
  With the aerodynamics in mind, the car was built to allow air to pass through to help reduce 
  temperatures in the engine, thus enabling the car to travel faster with no heating faults.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  To summarise, the need and importance of aerodynamics in F1 cars is crucial for the ability 
  of the drivers to reach top speeds. The creation of downforce helps with turning sharp 
  corners quickly, while also increasing stability. However, this increases drag, and if it is not 
  dealt with the car will move slower. To combat this extra drag, DRS is introduced to help 
  increase top speeds on straight paths. It does this by opening a flap that decreases 
  downforce thus decreasing drag. This is only to be used on straight paths and one second 
  behind the racer in front. Another way aerodynamics increase the speed of F1 cars is by 
  using the air intake to take away heat by heat transfer and using cooling liquid to cool down 
  the internals, cooling down the car in this way enables the driver to focus on the race rather 
  than if the engine overheats.
