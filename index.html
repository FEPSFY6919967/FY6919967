  Formula One (F1) cars are among the fastest vehicles on the planet, going as fast as 
  220mph (DIRECTV Insider, 2025), the exhilaration of watching these cars race against each 
  other has garnered a vast group of dedicated fans all over the world. An essential factor that 
  allows these vehicles to travel as fast as possible is aerodynamics (Pandit and Day, 2021), 
  which is the study of forces acting on objects moving through the air (Hall, 2023). But how 
  exactly does making an F1 car more aerodynamic increase the speed at which it can travel? 
  There are many areas in an F1 car that are greatly improved purely by the principles of 
  aerodynamics, such areas include downforce, DRS, cooling, among others. These all, in one 
  way or another, contribute to increasing the speed of the vehicle for the greatest chance of 
  winning a race. This article will go into more depth on these concepts and explain how 
  aerodynamic principles help F1 cars achieve high speeds.

  <h4>Downforce</h4>
  Aircrafts utilise their wings to produce a force called lift, which allows them to lift off into the 
  air. Lift occurs due to the air moving fast over the wings causing low air pressure to be 
  present above the wing, thus, air moves slower under the wing but has higher pressure 
  under the wing. This difference in air pressure produces lift. F1 does the opposite of this 
  process, the engineers want the air to accelerate under the wing to create the area of low air 
  pressure beneath the wing. They simply do this by inverting an aircraft wing. Instead of lift 
  the imbalance creates downforce. This force is vital for F1 cars as it helps to increase speed 
  at corners and decrease the damage to tyres, however, this does slightly increase the air 
  resistance, or drag, which can reduce straight line speeds (Ayushman, 2020).
